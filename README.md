# SICP Solutions

Exercises solutions implemented by [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) in [sicp](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/sicp) language.

And some solutions made by markdown with $LaTeX$ and [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io). 
It would be better to install browser extension to view them.
